# Smart Traffic Management System

## Overview

In the continually advancing sphere of information technology, urban areas worldwide are facing the challenge of traffic congestion, which has far-reaching implications on productivity, air quality, and overall quality of life. This project aims to address traffic congestion through an innovative AI-based traffic management system.

## 1.0 Problem Background

### 1.1 Introduction
Traffic congestion leads to increased travel times, higher fuel consumption, and significant air pollution. Current traffic management systems often rely on static schedules that do not adapt to real-time conditions.

### 1.2 The Problem Background
Many commuters experience delays due to unpredictable events such as accidents and roadwork, leading to frustration.

### 1.3 Significance of the Problem
Efficient traffic management can enhance environmental sustainability, reduce stress, and increase economic productivity.

### 1.4 The Need for an AI Solution
An AI-based solution can analyse traffic density, weather conditions, and incident reports to suggest real-time adjustments, creating a more responsive traffic management system.

## 2.0 Stakeholders and Empathy Map

### 2.1 Stakeholders/Users
- **Commuters**: Experience delays and travel stress.
- **Traffic Management Authorities**: Oversee traffic flow and safety.
- **Public Transport Operators**: Strive to maintain timely routes.
- **City Planners and Municipalities**: Use data for future infrastructure planning.
- **Environmental Advocates**: Promote solutions to reduce emissions.

## 3.0 System Architecture

### 3.1 System Architecture Overview
The Smart Traffic Management System consists of components designed to collect, process, and act on real-time traffic data.
